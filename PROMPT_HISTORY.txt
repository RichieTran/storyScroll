I worked with Claude Opus 4.6 to create a roadmap of my idea then passed it to Claude Code Sonnet 4.6 at first to start creating.

1. I'm creating a website where users can create videos for themselves or for tiktok/instagram where they find a story (paste, write, find off trending reddit stories) and use them with videos (their own or videos of minecraft parkour, or trackmania, or subway surfers, etc.)

Here is a roadmap I created:
"Phase 0: Setup & Tools
Dev Tools:

VS Code (code editor)
Git/GitHub (version control)
Node.js (frontend tooling)
Python 3.10+ (backend)
FFmpeg (video processing — free, install locally)

API Keys Needed:

TTS API — pick one:

Free: gTTS (Google TTS Python library, no key needed)
Better quality: ElevenLabs (free tier, needs API key)
Mid-tier: Google Cloud TTS (free tier, needs key)


AI Video Generation (stretch goal only): Replicate or Runway (paid)
Reddit: No API key needed — using public JSON endpoints


Phase 1: Frontend
Tech: React
Pages/views to build:

Home page — choose your path: Write, Paste, Upload, or Browse Reddit
Story input page — text area + file upload
Reddit browser page — trending/top stories, user picks one
Video selection page — upload your own OR pick from the video library
Loading page — progress indicator while backend processes
Result page — video player to watch + download button


Phase 2: Backend Foundation
Tech: Python with Flask or FastAPI
API endpoints:

POST /api/story — receive story text from frontend
GET /api/reddit/stories?sort=hot&subreddit=tifu — fetch Reddit stories
GET /api/videos — list available background videos from library
POST /api/generate — start video generation (takes story + video choice)
GET /api/video/<id> — serve the finished video for preview/download

Also set up:

File storage for uploads and generated videos
Error handling
.env file for any API keys (TTS)


Phase 3: Reddit Integration
Tech: Reddit public JSON endpoints (no API key)

Fetch from https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/hot.json and /top.json?t=week
Backend parses the JSON and sends clean story data to frontend (title, body, author, upvotes)
Frontend displays stories in a nice browsable list
User clicks one to select it

Subreddits to support:

r/tifu
r/nosleep
r/AmITheAsshole
r/relationship_advice
r/MaliciousCompliance
Custom subreddit input


Phase 4: Text-to-Speech
Tech: gTTS (free) or ElevenLabs (better quality)

Backend receives the story text
Generates an audio file (.mp3)
Stores it temporarily on the server
Handle long stories by chunking text if needed
Test with different story lengths


Phase 5: Video Library & Database
Tech: SQLite (simple) or PostgreSQL (more robust)
Database stores background video metadata:

id, name, category, file_path, duration
Categories like: Subway Surfers, Minecraft Parkour, Satisfying/Slime, GTA, etc.

Features:

Pre-load with royalty-free/stock clips
API endpoint to browse the library
Support user-uploaded videos (stored temporarily)


Phase 6: Video Compositing (The Core)
Tech: FFmpeg via Python (ffmpeg-python or subprocess)
This is where everything comes together:

Take the selected background video
Overlay the TTS audio
Add text captions/subtitles synced to the narration
Loop or trim the video to match audio length
Render final .mp4
Send to frontend → user watches in video player + downloads

Key challenges:

Syncing video length to audio length
Caption/subtitle timing
Processing time (consider async task queue for longer videos)


Phase 7: Polish & UX

Loading animations and progress bars
Error messages (TTS fails, video too long, etc.)
Mobile responsive design
Clean, modern UI styling
Maybe add a "history" of previously generated videos


Phase 8 (Stretch Goal): AI Video Generation
Tech: Replicate or Runway API (paid)

User enters a prompt describing what video they want
API generates a short video clip
That clip becomes the background instead of a library video
Note: slow (30s-2min) and costs money per generation"

right now can you focus on phases 1 and 2. for the front end, i want a colorscheme similar to vsCode where there is a dark grey background with "tabs" or sections for the user to navigate to, and the cards, buttons, tabs, etc. should be a lighter grey for now

2. can you make so when a user clicks one of of the reddit stories it shows the whole story? I think that is more efficient, also you can make it so when they click another one it closes the last one so only one can be open at all times

3. for duration, can you display the video length instead of a hard-coded duration

4. can you make it now so that when i choose a video, it uses gtts to add tts to the chosen story on top of the chosen video

5. can you switch to edge-tts instead of gtts

6. can you use cloudinary for this so when i host the site people can use the videos that i have in the backend

7. cloudinary only allows files under 100mb, is there a better option to store my videos?

8. Can you change it from edge-tts to elevenlabs, i have an account so let me know what i have to do

9. can you make it so the user can choose between two voices, a male (adam) and a female voice
